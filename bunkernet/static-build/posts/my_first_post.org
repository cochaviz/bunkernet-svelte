* Introduction

Just finished setting up this small blog system, so I hope you can see this and everything works as it should. And while there is still a lot to do, it's nice to have something tangible to build on top of.

** TODO All Hail Org-mode

Something about how cool org-mode is.

* Improvements

The aim of this document is to not make sense at all. Since, by the time you're reading this, I've hopefully implemented all the new features.

** Code highlighting

Firstly, code highlighting is not a thing yet

#+begin_src python :export both :results output
def main():
    print("A very long line in order to show what happens if the there is more code than space on the screen")

main()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: A very long line in order to show what happens if the there is more code than space on the screen

#+begin_quote
It would be really cool if you could just copy the code with a button.
All right, I'll make it work, just hold on a second...
#+end_quote

** LaTeX rendering

$\LaTeX$ also does not render yet, as demonstrated by this ugly thing:

$$  \Rrightarrow \text{Wooo, I'm so ugly } $$

Quick, cover your eyes!

$$ \begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = \theta_1 \cdot \cos^2( \phi)
\end{equation} $$

** Pictures

Maybe this will work right away!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Zohar from the future he actaully ran this... it doesn't (of course)
